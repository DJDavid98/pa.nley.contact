# Public repo for my personal site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can view the site at https://pa.nley.contact.

The site is hosted using CloudFlare Pages.

The site is built to be a general template with editable JSON data to change entries & eventually layout.
